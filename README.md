# 🅿️ Smart Parking Management System

An intelligent parking management system powered by machine learning to optimize space usage, reduce traffic congestion, and provide real-time parking availability. This project uses computer vision techniques and a trained ML model to detect and classify parking slots as "Occupied" or "Available" from camera images or video streams.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Real-time parking slot detection from images/video
- 🧠 ML model for slot classification (Occupied/Available)
- 📊 Space usage visualization and logging
- 📦 Easy deployment and modular design

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Capture Input**: Takes in an image or live video feed of the parking area(Still working)
2. **Preprocessing**: Detects and maps out individual parking slots.
3. **Prediction**: A trained ML model (e.g., CNN) predicts the status of each slot.
4. **Output**: Displays occupied vs. available slots in a UI or terminal output.
